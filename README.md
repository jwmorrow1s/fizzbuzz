# Fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz will take a single number as input, n on the command line and will print out an iteration from 1 to n, printing 'fizz' for numbers divisible by 3, 'buzz' or numbers divisible by 5,
'fizzbuzz' by numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, or else the number.

## Installation

There shouldn't be any installation necessary to run this. You should have both make and gcc on your machine. Sorry Windows folks.

## Usage

``make run n=${your number```

where ${your number} is the number you provide as an argument
${your number} must be an positive integer, or the value will be made 0.
If no value is provided for ${your number}, 100 is assumed.

## Contributing

Criticism is always welcome. I probably won't take any merge requests, because this was only an exercise.
